**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This release brings full support for Laravel 13 and PHP 8.4, implementing performance improvements for TTL management.

## ⚡ Laravel 13 & PHP 8.4 Support
- **Touch Cache Values**: Implemented the new `touch($key, $seconds)` method in `HypercacheioStore` to extend cache TTLs efficiently without re-storing values, matching the updated `Store` contract in Laravel 13.
- **Go Server touch Endpoint**: Added a corresponding `/api/hypercacheio/touch` endpoint to the Go daemon for lightning-fast asynchronous TTL updates.
- **Dependency Upgrades**: Full compatibility with PHP 8.4, Laravel 13, Testbench 11, and Pest 4.

---

# Release Notes - v1.7.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This release focuses on concurrent performance, resolving lock contention under high load.

## 💎 Sharded Cache Architecture
- **32 Cache Shards**: Replaced the global write lock in the Go server with a 32-shard memory map. This isolates concurrent writes and read-modifies, boosting throughput by up to 300% on multi-core systems.

---

# Release Notes - v1.6.6

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This release significantly improves the memory management of the Go server by introducing proactive background cleanup for expired items.

## 🧹 Proactive Garbage Collection
The Go server is now smarter about memory management. Instead of relying purely on request-time checks, it now runs a background "janitor" process.
- **Background Sweep**: Every 30 seconds, the server identifies and removes expired cache entries and locks from its internal memory.
- **SQLite Synchronization**: Expired items found during the sweep are automatically purged from the persistent SQLite database, ensuring your storage remains clean and compact.
- **Accurate Monitoring**: The inspection API now strictly filters out expired items, providing a precise view of the active state in your Filament dashboards.

---

# Release Notes - v1.6.5

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This release focuses on observability and management of the HA cluster, introducing real-time statistics and advanced synchronization inspection.

## 📊 Cluster Observability
The Go server now tracks and exposes detailed replication statistics, allowing you to monitor the health and throughput of your HA cluster.
- **Binary Replication Stats**: View real-time counts of broadcasts sent and updates received via the TCP engine.
- **Item Inspection Endpoint**: New `/api/hypercacheio/items` endpoint allows for deep inspection of the in-memory cache and active locks.

## 🔄 Improved Service Management
- **One-Command Restart**: Introducing `php artisan hypercacheio:go-server service:restart` to quickly bounce the system service on both Linux (systemd) and macOS (launchd).

---

# Release Notes - v1.6.4

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This release completes the decoupling of the Go server binary from static configuration, making it perfectly suited for CI/CD pipelines where binaries are built once and deployed to many environments.

## 🚀 Full Configuration Injection
The Go binary is now 100% dynamic. Every configuration option defined in your Laravel `hypercacheio.php` file is explicitly passed to the binary at runtime via command-line flags.

- **Dynamic HA Toggling**: Use the new `--ha-mode` flag to enable or disable the replication engine on the fly.
- **Environment Agnostic**: Since all values (SSL paths, ports, tokens, prefixes) are passed during the `start` or `make-service` commands, you no longer need to worry about re-compiling the binary when moving between staging and production.

---

# Release Notes - v1.6.3

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This update focuses on making the Go server configuration more dynamic and resilient to runtime environment changes.

## ⚙️ Dynamic Configuration
The Go binary now supports environment variables as fallbacks for all key configuration flags. This means you can now set your configuration directly in your environment or service file, and the binary will pick them up automatically.

- **Available Environment Variables**:
    - `HYPERCACHEIO_API_TOKEN`
    - `HYPERCACHEIO_SQLITE_PATH`
    - `HYPERCACHEIO_CACHE_PREFIX`
    - `HYPERCACHEIO_GO_PORT`
    - `HYPERCACHEIO_GO_HOST`
    - `HYPERCACHEIO_PEER_ADDRS`

## 🛠 Passable Config Flags
We've updated the `hypercacheio:go-server start` and `make-service` commands to explicitly pass the `--prefix` and `--sqlite-path` config values from your Laravel configuration to the Go binary. 

This ensures that any changes you make to your `.env` file are immediately reflected in the Go daemon when restarted, without needing to re-compile the binary.

---

# Release Notes - v1.6.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This patch release fixes a CI/CD infrastructure issue.

## 🛠 Bug Fixes
*   **CI Stability**: Fixed a directory creation issue in `GoServerCommandTest.php` that occurred on certain Linux environments when using `resource_path()`. The test suite now uses its own local `tests/bin` directory for temporary binary management.

---

# Release Notes - v1.6.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This major update introduces **Active-Active High Availability (HA)** mode, providing real-time state synchronization across multiple Go cache nodes using a high-performance binary TCP protocol.

## 🔄 Active-Active HA Mode
Version 1.6.0 transforms Hyper-Cache-IO into a truly distributed cache system for high-availability clusters.
*   **Decentralized Synchronisation**: Every application server can now run as an active peer. There is no single point of failure.
*   **Binary Replication**: We've implemented a custom binary protocol over TCP for inter-node communication, ensuring that cache updates are replicated in microseconds.
*   **Mesh Networking**: Configure multiple peers via `HYPERCACHEIO_PEER_ADDRS` to form a resilient full-mesh cluster.
*   **Automatic Bootstrapping**: New nodes automatically "sync up" their memory state from existing peers as soon as they join the cluster.

## 🛡️ Atomic HA Distributed Locking
Distributed locks have been re-engineered for the cluster environment.
*   **Thread Safety**: Locks now use Go's `sync.RWMutex` to wrap atomic check-and-set operations.
*   **Global Awareness**: Lock acquisitions are broadcast across all peers, ensuring that a lock held on Node A is respected by Node B and Node C instantly.

## 🔑 Clean Key Management
*   **Standardized Prefixing**: We've aligned our key handling with Laravel's core `Cache\Repository`. Internal redundant prefixing has been removed, ensuring that your `config('cache.prefix')` works exactly as expected without "double-prefixing" issues.

## 🔍 Cluster Connectivity Diagnostics
The connectivity check command is now HA-aware:
*   **Peer Verification**: Running `php artisan hypercacheio:connectivity-check` will now iterate through every node in your cluster, verifying HTTP API connectivity and replication consistency.

## 📦 Upgrade
1.  Update the package via Composer.
2.  Enable HA mode in your `.env`:
    ```dotenv
    HYPERCACHEIO_HA_ENABLED=true
    HYPERCACHEIO_PEER_ADDRS=10.0.0.1:7400,10.0.0.2:7400
    ```
3.  Re-compile and restart your Go servers:
    ```bash
    php artisan hypercacheio:go-server compile
    php artisan hypercacheio:go-server restart
    ```

# Release Notes - v1.5.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This update moves the binary storage location and adds a configuration toggle for direct SQLite execution.

## 📁 Binary Path Change
*   **Location**: We have moved the default Go build output from `storage/hypercacheio/bin` to `resources/hypercacheio/bin`. 
*   **Commitable Binaries**: This allows you to compile binaries locally and commit them to your version control system, enabling production deployments without requiring a Go installation on the server.

## ⚙️ Configuration
*   **Direct SQLite Toggle**: Added `HYPERCACHEIO_GO_DIRECT_SQLITE` to the `go_server` config. Set to `true` (default) for maximum performance, or `false` to use the legacy Artisan relay.

---

# Release Notes - v1.5.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This major update introduces direct SQLite integration for the Go server, providing significant performance improvements.

## 🚀 Native SQLite Backend
The Go server now interacts directly with the SQLite database.
*   **Performance**: By bypassing the `php artisan` bootstrap overhead, cache operation response times have dropped from ~50ms to **less than 1ms**.
*   **PHP Serialization**: Implemented native PHP serialization support in Go to ensure full compatibility with data stored by the Laravel application.
*   **Atomic Operations**: Native support for atomic `add` and distributed locking directly in the Go daemon.

---

# Release Notes - v1.4.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This update focuses on simplifying the storage architecture and optimizing the package footprint.

## 📁 Storage Consolidation

We have moved the default storage location from `storage/cache/hypercacheio/` to a more direct `storage/hypercacheio/`. This affects:
*   **Database**: The SQLite file is now at `storage/hypercacheio/hypercacheio.sqlite`.
*   **Go Binaries**: Compiled Go servers are now stored in `storage/hypercacheio/bin/`.

These paths remain fully configurable via `config/hypercacheio.php`.

## 📦 Package Optimization

*   **Binaries Removed**: Pre-compiled Go binaries have been removed from the core package. This significantly reduces the installation size and ensures that the server is always compiled specifically for your environment's OS and architecture.
*   **CI Improvements**: CI pipelines have been adjusted to handle the new directory structures.

## 📦 Upgrade

If you are upgrading from `v1.4.0`, please move your existing data:
```bash
mv storage/cache/hypercacheio storage/hypercacheio
```

Then update your package:
```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

# Release Notes - v1.4.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This major update introduces a high-performance Go-based synchronization server, robust service management, and enhanced connectivity diagnostics with firewall troubleshooting.

## 🚀 Standalone Go Server (Experimental)

We have introduced a standalone Go binary to handle inter-node cache synchronization.
*   **Performance**: Drastically reduces the overhead of handling cache requests by bypassing the full Laravel framework stack for internal peer-to-peer communication.
*   **Concurrency**: Built on Go's lightweight goroutines, allowing thousands of concurrent cache operations with minimal memory usage.
*   **Daemon Mode**: Runs as a persistent background process.

## 🛡️ Service Management

You can now easily run the Go server as a system service with auto-restart capabilities:
*   **Command**: `php artisan hypercacheio:go-server make-service`
*   **Linux**: Generates a `systemd` unit file for high-availability deployments.
*   **macOS**: Generates a `launchd` plist for local development or Apple Silicon servers.

## 🔍 Intelligent Connectivity Diagnostics

The `hypercacheio:connectivity-check` command is now significantly more powerful:
*   **Pre-flight checks**: Pings the local node first to ensure the cache server (Laravel or Go) is actually listening.
*   **Firewall Advice**: If a port is blocked, the command detects your OS and provides the exact `ufw`, `firewalld`, or `socketfilterfw` commands to unblock it.

## 🛠 Improvements

*   **Auto-Installation**: The Go server CLI can now detect if Go is missing and offer to install it via system package managers.
*   **Improved CI**: GitHub Actions now verify Go server compilation across AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.
*   **Test Suite**: Expanded coverage with new tests for the Go bridge and service management commands.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

To switch to the Go server, update your `.env`:
```dotenv
HYPERCACHEIO_SERVER_TYPE=go
```

# Release Notes - v1.3.2

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This release focuses on code quality, documentation, and test coverage improvements for the `HypercacheioSecondaryUrls` helper and the overall package configuration.

## 🛠 Improvements

*   **`HypercacheioSecondaryUrls` Helper Rewrite**: The helper function has been completely rewritten with:
    *   Proper PHPDoc blocks with full `@param`, `@return`, and `@example` tags.
    *   URL trimming — whitespace around URLs is automatically stripped.
    *   Empty-entry filtering — consecutive delimiters, leading/trailing delimiters no longer produce empty entries.
    *   URL validation — only entries passing `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` are included; invalid URLs are silently discarded.
    *   Fixed `$delimeter` → `$delimiter` typo and added explicit `string` type hint.
    *   Cleaner functional implementation using `array_map`/`array_filter`.

*   **Configuration Comments**: All config block comments in `config/hypercacheio.php` have been enhanced with detailed descriptions, `Env:` variable references, expected formats, default values, and practical guidance.

*   **README Enhancements**:
    *   Added `HYPERCACHEIO_SECONDARY_URLS` and `HYPERCACHEIO_ASYNC` environment variable documentation to the Primary Server setup section.
    *   Added a full **Environment Variables Reference** table.
    *   Refreshed the Advanced Configuration code block to match the actual config.

## ✅ New Tests

*   **13 new Pest tests** for `HypercacheioSecondaryUrls` covering:
    *   Null, empty string, and whitespace-only input
    *   Single and multiple URL parsing (with and without whitespace)
    *   Empty-entry filtering from consecutive delimiters
    *   Invalid URL rejection via `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL`
    *   Custom delimiter support
    *   Leading/trailing delimiter handling
    *   Sequential array re-indexing

## 📦 Upgrade

# Release Notes - v1.3.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This patch release fixes a critical issue with distributed locking on Secondary nodes.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Lock Reliability**: Fixed an issue where `Cache::lock()` and `release()` would fail silently on Secondary servers if `async_requests` was enabled (default). These operations are now forced to run synchronously to ensure they return the correct `true` or `false` result, regardless of the async configuration.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

This update is strongly recommended for all users operating in a Primary/Secondary cluster configuration.

---

# Release Notes - v1.3.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This major update introduces a new Connectivity Check command, improved async processing architecture, and significant code optimizations.

## ✨ New Features

*   **Connectivity Check Command**: Run `php artisan hypercacheio:connectivity-check` to instantly verify communication between your Primary and Secondary nodes. It tests all endpoints (Ping, Add, Get, Put, Delete, Lock) and provides a detailed report.
*   **Fire-and-Forget Architecture**: Async requests now use a robust Promise tracking system with graceful shutdown. This ensures that write operations from Secondary nodes return immediately to the user while guaranteeing completion in the background, eliminating previous reliability issues with fire-and-forget requests.

## 🛠 Improvements

*   **Refactoring**: Core logic has been optimized by extracting shared SQLite operations into the `InteractsWithSqlite` trait, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
*   **Configuration Alignment**: The `CacheController` now respects the specific store configuration defined in `config/cache.php`, ensuring consistency with the `HypercacheioStore` implementation.
*   **Testing**: The entire test suite has been converted to **Pest PHP** for cleaner, more expressive tests.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

This update is fully backward compatible. For best results, ensure your configuration files are up to date.

---

# Release Notes - v1.2.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This patch release adds names to the internal API routes for better identification and management within Laravel applications.

## ✨ New Features

*   **Named Routes**: All internal API routes now have names prefixed with `hypercacheio.`.
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.get`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.add`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.put`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.forget`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.lock`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.release-lock`

This makes it easier to use these routes with Laravel's `route()` helper and improves visibility in tools like `php artisan route:list`.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

This update is drop-in compatible and recommended for all users.
